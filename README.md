## Introduction

Every contributor should remember one thing: Labels on PRs are a must-have: `gdg-mit-os`, `l1`, `l2`, or `l3`.
- `l1`: 10 points
- `l2`: 25 points
- `l3`: 45 points

---

## Important Points for Contributors

- **Meaningful Contributions**: Build your GitHub profile with meaningful badges and PRs.
- **Manual Verification**: Our team will verify most of your PRs.
- **Avoid Spam**: Do not submit spam PRs or address similar issues repeatedly.
- **GitHub Profile**: If all of your contributions are meaningful to the projects, we have the potential to increase perks and opportunities, including from existing project admins.

---

## Meaningful Contribution Guidelines

- Beginners can contribute to README files, workflows, or documentation.
- PRs for README, workflow, or documentation will be evaluated and potentially upgraded based on completeness.
- Do not create multiple document change issues. Inform the contributor who worked on the documentation for future updates.
- Follow a first-come, first-served approach for issues.
- Participate in only one role: PA, lead, or Contributor.

For more details on how to contribute to projects, check - [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

## Instructions for Leads and Project Admins (PAs)

- **Fair Issue Assignment**: Follow a first-come, first-served approach.
- **Avoid Partiality**: Ensure fair assignment of issues, don‚Äôt let PRs get merged without raising proper issues.

---

## Report Issues to Us

- **Minimal Changes**: PRs with minimal changes that are not impactful and are being awarded `l2` or `l3` points.
- **Instant PR Acceptance**: PRs accepted instantly without proper review.

### Non-Considerable PRs

- Multiple documentation or workflow issues.
- Exploiting personal connections with PAs or leads.
- Repeated documentation or workflow contributions.
- Code snippets or template-related PRs.

---

### Spam PRs or PRs Won't be Considered:

1. If you create multiple issues on documentation or workflow, your PRs won‚Äôt be considered.
2. If you know the PA or Lead and exploit it to make more PRs, your PRs won‚Äôt be considered.
3. If you completely depend on documentation or workflow or GitHub bots, only the first 150 points will be considered. Focus on a variety of contributions.
4. Contributors, you are free to create any number of PRs in any repos, excluding a few repos listed below. Sticking to a particular repo will help you gain strong knowledge of the project and the tech stack. However, if we notice you spamming PRs or issues, severe action will be taken.

#### Note: We request everyone to follow the above guidelines. We aim to make open source accessible to everyone, including beginners. If you follow the instructions, it will help us bring more perks to you. Otherwise, it may push us to verify your PRs more thoroughly.
